# Stock Price Prediction: Model Visualizations and Explanations
1. Introduction This project focuses on predicting stock prices using ARFIMA and Gradient Boosting models.
    The dataset used contains stock prices along with various features like 'Close', 'Volume', 'Moving Averages', etc.
2. The goal is to preprocess the data, apply two different models, and evaluate their performance.
3. Dataset The dataset is assumed to be a CSV file containing stock price data. The data should include columns
   such as 'Date', 'Close', 'Volume', and possibly other features such as lagged returns and moving averages. The
   dataset is first cleaned, and missing values are handled by forward filling or imputation.
4. Preprocessing Steps The preprocessing steps performed include: 1. Data loading and examination of missing
   values.
     1. Filling or dropping missing data.
     2. Stationarity tests (ADF Test).
     3. Feature Engineering (e.g., LaggedReturns, Moving Averages).
5. Data splitting into training and testing sets.
6. Models This project uses two main models to predict stock prices: 1. ARFIMA Model: - Aimed at capturing the
long memory effect and non-stationarity in stock prices. - Includes differencing of time series if required. 2.
Gradient Boosting Model: - A robust machine learning model using various features including lagged returns,
volume, and moving averages.
7. Model Evaluation The models are evaluated using various metrics such as:
   1. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
   2. MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   3. MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) The performance of both models is compared to determine which provides better accuracy and reliability.
9. Report and Presentation A comprehensive report is prepared that includes the following:
    1. Methodology and analysis of the stock price prediction task.
    2. Findings from the ARFIMA and Gradient Boosting models.
    3. Visualizations like performance plots, error metrics graphs.
    4. Recommendations for trading strategies based on the findings.
11. Installation Instructions To run the project, follow these steps: 
    1. Install the required dependencies: - numpy - pandas - matplotlib - statsmodels - sklearn - pmdarima
    2. Run the `stock forecasting.py` script after setting the correct path to your dataset.
12. How to Use
    1. Place your dataset (e.g., 'stock data.csv') in the same directory or specify the path in the script.
    2. Run the Python script `stock forecasting.py`.
    3. The script will load the data, perform preprocessing, apply both ARFIMA and Gradient Boosting models, and output performance metrics and predictions.
